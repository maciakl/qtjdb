QTJDB - Quick and Tiny Java Database
(c) 2004 Lukasz Grzegorz Maciak


System Requirements:

	Java 1.4 VM
	Bash Shell (to run the compilation shell scripts)

Automatic Compilation:

	To compile and setup QTJDB run setup script includent in the package. The script will produce a new directory named QTJDB and copy
	all the needed files there.
	
Manual Setup:

	If you can't run the bash script compile java manually using javac or equivalent. Rename data.template to qtjdb.dat and config.template
	to .qtjdb. You can edit the .qtjdb file to change the name of the input file, and change other properties.
	
Running QTJDB Server:

	java QTJDBServer

Running QTJDB Client:

	java QTJDBClient [host] [port]
	
	The client app takes two parameters - first one is the name or IP addres of the host machine, the second one is the port
	on which the client should connect to the host.
	
	The default port on which the server is listening is 1337 but this can be changed by editing the .qtjdb file.
	
Javadoc Documentation:

	Some javadoc documentation exists, but it is vastly incomplete. You can generate the javadoc pages using the standard javadoc command syntax.
